## A blueprint for 2024

I always try to improve myself and learn more. The last few years I have gotten very interested in self improvement. I have devoured books, courses, podcasts and other and resources on the subject. This time I want to share some of the things I have learned during a course I followed. The focus on this is to create a blueprint for the new year. How to use repetition and how to model proven practices to defeat bigger problems and reach your goals. 

Here are ten steps to help you create a blueprint for 2024, I know that I will be using several of them myself. I think that number 2 is especially powerful.

1. **1: In 2024 its time to audit your inner circle**
    - If you find yourself making excuses to someone when explaining what you want to achieve. Change the conversation with them. 
    - Stop trying to convince them, just be you. 
    - Don´t let your dreams go because others don´t believe the same. 
    - Stop waiting for permission

2. **2: Solve bigger problems**
    - Don´t look for bigger problems to go away. Look to get better at handling bigger problems.
3. **3: It´s on me**
    - I need to stay connected, I need to model proven practices.
    - I need to be a different version of me. If the things outside is not going to change, i need to change to lead the path.
4. **4: Who is steering your ship?**
    - We have to watch who is navigation our ship: is it coworkers, is it past failures, regrets, the media, 
    - BE the captain of your ship! BE the captain of your future. 
5. **5: I will meet this day with love**
    - Serve more, care more, fall in love with the product. 
    - If you actually know you created something that changed their lives you would love for them to get it. 
6. **6: Be bold**
    - it is not time to let imposter syndrom win
    - it is not time to worry about being judged
    - This is the time for uncomfortable action. Whether its starting something new or scaling something. 
    - Your next level of life is always on the other side of the thing you are afraid of facing. 
    - Go into that place that you have been avoiding. 
7. **7: Focus on the fix**
    - See it, feel it, learn from it. Then put all of your energy on the solution
8. **8: Look for the little things**
    - Small hinges can swing a big door. Small changes can change large things. 
    - Small little shifts in your life
    - What routines can you subtlety shift? 
    - How can you shift your routine a little bit in the morning to improve your day ?
    - What routines can you shift, how can you improve your journaling?
9. **9: I will persist until i succeed**
    - The reward is not at the beginning of the journey
    - Don´t go to the end of your life not knowing your full potential.
10. **10: Who vs how?**  
    - This comes back to modelling proven practices. You have a gap in your life where you are a at a certain place and want to get to another place. 
    - How can i do this, how can i get there? Instead ask who has done this before, who went there before? Model proven practices. 
    - Who has already done it, who has the steps, the roadmap or the blueprint to what you want to do? Get it from them, no matter what!
    - The map is the model of the proven practices. 


Ill leave you with a quote from Dean Graziosi:
