# Troubleshooting the site

If having issues with missing files and warnings for the theme or for instance if shortcodes canÂ´t be found. Then this helped fix the issue. 

```
hugo mod clean
hugo server
```

Another suggestion for the shortcodes was to add /* and */ inside the {{shortcode }} brackets, but this broke the site and after cleaning it did not render shortcodes properly. Cleaning worked well.
